# Melter

This project is depricated in favor of Typora, which is superior in many ways. I've started this project as a sandbox to learn JavaScript on the desktop, and I'm leaving it here for reference, but I will not develop this further.

This repo is currently still very early in development (proof of concept). This Markdown editor is based on Mou. We've created this
because we think we could do a better job, for less money (== zero, nit, nada).

If you just want to use the app, just download one of our build(s). The code is not stable, a bit dirty but functional. Keep in
touch to let us know what you think is important to have as a feature.

# Melter

This repo is currently still very early in development (proof of concept). This Markdown editor is based on Mou. We've created this
because we think we could do a better job, for less money (== zero, nit, nada).

If you just want to use the app, just download one of our build(s). The code is not stable, a bit dirty but functional. Keep in
touch to let us know what you think is important to have as a feature.
